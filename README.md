# Hostname Replacer - Chrome Extension

Replace the hostname with the one you defined â€” the remaining information in the URL will be retained.

## Description

This extension was created to help in a very specific situation. As a developer, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to run a task repeatedly, and this extension was created to speed up this process.

During the development of a web application, you may need to switch between local server URL and remote server URL, but you may need to keep the rest of the URL information, such as paths and parameters.

This extension allows you to define a URL and whenever you need to change the current URL to the one you defined, you can do it with one click.
